# ceasar-cipher

This is a Ruby program I created that implements a Caesar cipher which is one the most known and simpliest encryption techniques.
It asks the user to input a string and and number to left shift by. It handles both lowercase and capital letters, any miscellaneous non-alphabetical characters and spaces.
